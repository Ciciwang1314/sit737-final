                            The legal channels switch was officially released on December 10, announcing
                            the cooperation between Tencent and nintendo. Since then, the world's three 
                            major consoles ps, xbox and switch have all been listed in the legal channels 
                            version in China, and console games are expected to become the next growth point
                            in the industry in the future. Combined with the rapid growth of stand-alone 
                            games, the console as its main publishing platform will also enjoy the dividend 
                            of market growth. Moreover, console games have a high unit price and strong user 
                            stickiness. The global market has reached $47.9 billion, accounting for 32% of the 
                            total game market, which is attractive to domestic manufacturers.
